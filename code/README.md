Workshop code included here includes some example pieces of code for the workshop and some co-designed code based on workshop feedback.

- [workshop_test.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_test.py) is an introduction to netcdf and xarray and plotting
- [workshop_shape.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_shape.py) is an introduction to shapefiles and plotting
- [workshop_station_shape.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_station_shape.py) is an introduction to reading in excel/csv station data from EMI and plotting
- [workshop_correls.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_correls.py) is an introduction to statistics packages and correlations using netcdf files of SSTs and rainfall

- [workshop_station_multiple.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_station_multiple.py) and [workshop_station_multiple_vars.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_station_multiple_vars.py) are able to deal with multiple excel/csv files of station data and allow selection of multiple variables

- [workshop_new_WRF.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_new_WRF.py) and [workshop_WRF_obs_stats.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_WRF_obs_stats.py) are designed to deal with WRF near-term forecasts as spreadsheets and netcdf files so they can be resampled to new timeframes and be compared with observations from stations

- [workshop_forecast_MOWIE.py](https://github.com/ellendyer/python_workshop/blob/main/code/workshop_forecast_MOWIE.py) takes WRF near-term forecasts as spreadsheets and prints them out as Telegram formatted messages
